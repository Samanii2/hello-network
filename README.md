# Hello, Network!
> A simple python 3 script that prints "Hello, Network!" in 22 diffrent languages.

## Concept
The basic idea is to change the metaphysical constant from "the world" (that speculative realist philosophers such as [Markus Gabriel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0vbXcRcHNA) points out doesn't exist). To the network, as an [intra-active](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0SnstJoEec) phenomena.

## Getting started
To check if you have python on your machine open up a command line window and write:
```
python -V
```
If you have Python on your machine, the command should print the [Python version number](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-v) and exit.
### Prerequisites
* [Python 3+](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

### Installing
A straightforward guide how to install Python on your machine can find [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

## Running the code
To run the code open up a command line window and write:
```

```
Default language is set to English. You can also change the language by typing it in like this:
