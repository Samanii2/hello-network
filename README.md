# Hello, Network!
A simple python script that prints "Hello, Network!" to a terminal.

## Concept
The basic idea is to change the metaphysical constant from "the world" (that speculative realist philosophers such as [Markus Gabriel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0vbXcRcHNA) points out doesn't exist). To the network, as an [intra-active](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0SnstJoEec) phenomena.

## Getting started
To check if you have python on your machine open up a command line window and write:
```
python -V
```
If you have Python on your machine, the command should print the [Python version number](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-v) and exit.
